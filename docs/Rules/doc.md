# Rules

Every rule of this project, in one page. `verify` enforces the ones marked **(verify)**;
the rest are read by the generators or by whoever writes the hand-written files.
Nothing here is repeated elsewhere in `docs/` — other pages link here. The command that
makes each kind of change is in [Workflow](../Workflow/doc.md).

## Authoring

- **Generate over hand-write.** A file that can be rendered from a template, a collector or a
  declaration must be. Hand-written code is contracts, adapters, `sandbox/internal/` and
  `handler.go` only; a new hand-written file needs a reason why generation cannot
  cover it.
- **Every file is an instance of a pattern.** New code copies an existing sibling exactly:
  same filenames, same function names, same ordering. If no pattern fits, define and document
  the pattern first — `verify` and the collectors read shape by convention, so a one-off
  breaks them.
- **Deterministic and idempotent.** Same input, same bytes out: `agnos build` run twice must
  leave the tree unchanged.
- A generated file is never edited — the `always` rows of
  [GeneratedFiles](../GeneratedFiles/doc.md), `(gen)` in [Structure](../Structure/doc.md).
  Change the declaration it is rendered from, then run `build`.
- `sandbox/internal/generated/` holds every package `build` rewrites whole and nothing else: no
  file there is ever edited, and no hand-written package is ever put there. It holds the
  registries and config alone — code that is the same in every project is an `OpinionatedAgnos<X>`
  lib, not a generated package. Importing a package an older build generated there names its
  replacement. **(verify)** A package mixing a
  generated file with a hand-written one — a command, a route, a database — stays under
  `sandbox/internal/`.
- Generated `.go` is gofmt'ed as it is written, so a regenerated tree diffs to zero against one
  a formatting editor has saved.
- `build` compiles `./cmd/... ./sandbox/... ./adapters/...`, never `./...`.

## Extensions

- What this project generates is declared in `AgnosConfig/extensions.yaml`, one key per
  mechanic, and nowhere else: `build` never infers a mechanic from a directory being present.
  A missing declaration is a hard error, not a default. **(verify)**
- Only the keys of the catalog may appear, and no mechanic that renders into the sandbox is on while `sandbox`
  is off. **(verify)**
- `false` means *stop generating*, never *delete*: `agnos` leaves what the mechanic already
  wrote exactly as it is, for the project to keep or edit by hand. Removing those files is
  what an `<x>-purge` does — and it is the same command that writes the `false`.
- The declaration is written by `agnos enable-extension` / `disable-extension` and
  by every `<x>-init` / `<x>-purge` pair, never by hand.
- Every key is in [Extensions](../Extensions/doc.md).

## Layers

- `sandbox/` is closed: a file there imports only `sandbox/` packages — the stdlib included. A
  capability from outside (io, text, sorting, hashing, templating) is restated as a contract
  under `sandbox/deps/` and reached as `sandbox.Deps.<Contract>`. **(verify)**
- `sandbox/` holds only `api`, `constructors`, `deps`, `internal` and `new.go`. **(verify)**
- `sandbox/api/*` imports nothing but the loose `sandbox/deps` package, for `Sandbox.Deps`, and
  the `sandbox/deps/OpinionatedAgnos<X>` contracts, for the aliases a mechanic's api file is made
  of. **(verify)**
- Every function of `sandbox/internal/` takes `sandbox *api.Sandbox` as
  its first parameter and nothing else standing for the outside world: deps is reached as
  `sandbox.Deps.<Contract>`, and the rest of the api as `sandbox.<Field>`. Holding the api is
  what lets one part of it call another, and what makes a field a caller replaced take effect
  everywhere.
- `sandbox/deps/<x>/` imports nothing at all: a contract is written in Go's builtin types only,
  and the adapter converts. The loose `sandbox/deps/*.go` may name `sandbox/deps` packages, to
  compose `deps.Deps`, and an `OpinionatedAgnos<X>/` contract may import other contracts under
  `sandbox/deps/` and nothing else. **(verify)**
- A dep states a library's raw capability and never a decision of the project using it — except
  an **opinionated lib**, `OpinionatedAgnos<X>`, the one kind of dep that carries an agnos mechanic
  itself: `OpinionatedAgnosCli` (the command types, the dispatch chain, binding, failures, triggers),
  `OpinionatedAgnosServer` (the route types, the request chain, binding, json-schema, writers),
  `OpinionatedAgnosFront` (the file layer of `assets/front/`), `OpinionatedAgnosDatabase` (the readers
  every `methods.go` shares). Each mechanic's `-init` installs its lib, and a mechanic is never on
  without it. **(verify)** The lib holds no dep: what it reaches the outside world through is
  handed to it — a `MainProps` built by the generated registry, or the one dep a call needs as
  its first parameter. What stays in the sandbox is what the project declares or edits.
- Every `sandbox/api/<x>.go` other than `sandbox.go`, `command.go` and `route.go` is a field of
  the `Sandbox`, built by the `New<X>(sandbox) api.<X>` its `sandbox/internal/<x>/new.go` —
  or `sandbox/internal/<x>/<x>/new.go`, for a layer split into packages — declares — the one name `sandbox/constructors/<x>/constructor.go` calls. A contract with no
  such file is a field nothing fills, and no constructor is written for it. **(verify)**
- `sandbox/new.go` is one `<x>.Constructor(&self)` per directory of `sandbox/constructors/`,
  in name order, and nothing else. The directories are the list, so a constructor written by
  hand is called exactly like a generated one.
- Every directory under `sandbox/constructors/` holds a `constructor.go` declaring
  `Constructor(sandbox *api.Sandbox)`, and is named after the package it declares.
  **(verify)**
- `sandbox/constructors/<x>/constructor.go` is written **once**, by the first `build` that
  finds the contract, and no build rewrites it: how a field of the `Sandbox` is built — wrapped,
  decorated, swapped for another implementation — is the project's, not the generator's.
- `sandbox/api/projectsandbox.go` and `sandbox/api/projectconfig.go` are written **once**, by `start`,
  and no build rewrites them: `api.Sandbox` embeds `api.ProjectSandbox` and `api.Config` embeds
  `api.ProjectConfig`, so what the project declares there is read as `sandbox.<Field>` and
  `sandbox.Config.<Field>`. Neither is a field of its own, so neither gets a constructor: a
  `ProjectSandbox` field is filled by a package of the project's under `sandbox/constructors/`, a
  `ProjectConfig` one in `sandbox/constructors/config/constructor.go`. Each must be there while the
  file embedding it is. **(verify)**
- Every file of `sandbox/api/` and `sandbox/deps/` parses, and every exported type, func, const
  and var in them carries a doc comment — [PublicApi](../PublicApi/doc.md) is generated from
  those comments. **(verify)**
- `adapters/` is the only place OS-bound and third-party code lives, and holds only
  `bindings` and `impls`. **(verify)**
- Every `adapters/impls/<adapter>/` exports `Bind(deps *deps.Deps)` and carries the
  `adapter.yaml` naming the dep it fills. **(verify)**
- Every binding fills every field of `Deps` **exactly once**: zero is a nil func that panics
  on first use, two is a silent overwrite in which the last binder wins. Which adapter fills
  which field is read from `adapter.yaml`, never from the body of a `Bind`. **(verify)**
- `adapters/bindings/<name>/binding.yaml` is the only place the choice of adapter is
  recorded; `set-adapter` is its only editor. A binding with no `binding.yaml` is
  hand-written and no build touches it.
- Every type of `sandbox/api/` is convertible: its underlying type is identical
  in a copy of the package made elsewhere, or it is a struct the generator can
  write a converter for. No generics, no `chan`, no anonymous struct or
  interface, no embedded field but a struct the package declares, and no identifier that is neither predeclared
  nor declared in the package. `Sandbox.Deps` is the one field exempt, because
  it is the one field that does not cross: a consumer installs the api of a
  repo, never its wiring, so the copy drops it. A mechanic's surface — an alias of an
  `OpinionatedAgnos<X>` type, and a part holding only those — is exempt for the same reason: it is
  the lib's, and the copy drops it too. This is what makes every agnos
  repo installable as a dep. **(verify)**
- `cmd/main/` wires an adapter into the sandbox and holds no logic.

## Naming

- A `Deps` field is the title-cased `sandbox/deps/<dir>` (`iodeps` -> `deps.IoDeps`). Always
  use that spelling; an added contract never renames an existing one.
- An adapter's binder is always `Bind(deps *deps.Deps)` in `adapters/impls/<adapter>/<adapter>.go`.
- A command handler is always `Handle(sandbox *api.Sandbox, props *commandprops.CommandProps, input *Input, response *api.CommandResponse) error`.
- A package's first file is named after the package (`sandbox/deps/iodeps/iodeps.go`,
  `adapters/impls/osio/osio.go`); a second file is named after what it holds.
- A dep is named after the contract it installs, `<x>deps`; an adapter `<impl><x>`, after what
  backs it (`sortdeps`, adapters `stdsort` and `reflectsort`). The two are separate names because one dep may have several adapters.
- Reusable logic goes in `sandbox/internal/<pkg>/`, one directory per concern.

## Output channels

| Channel | Stream | Carries | Silenced |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deps.StdDeps.Printf` | stdout | The result (listings, version, help) | never |
| `deps.StdDeps.Logf` | stderr | Progress | by a middleware that turns it off |
| `deps.StdDeps.Eprintf` | stderr | Usage errors and failures | never |

Never `fmt.Printf`. A generated cli declares no `--quiet`: add it as a
`--middleware` whose handler silences `Log` when the project wants one.

## Exit codes

| Code | Const | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `api.ExitOk` | Done |
| 1 | `api.ExitFailure` | A well-formed command failed |
| 2 | `api.ExitUsage` | Bad command line: unknown command or flag, leftover positional, missing required, bad or out-of-range number |

## Docs

- A doc is `docs/<Name>/{doc.md,doc.yaml}`; sub-docs nest as `docs/<Name>/<Sub>/`. Other
  files in a doc dir are assets. Create and delete them with `add-doc` / `remove-doc`.
- Every `docs/**` dir has a parsable `doc.yaml`; a first-level doc names at least one theme of
  `AgnosConfig/themes.yaml`, a sub-doc names none. A theme no doc names renders no README
  section and is not an error. **(verify)**
- A theme only groups a doc into a section of `README.md`.
- Every entry of `AgnosConfig/structure.yaml` names a path that exists — a directory
  when it declares `dir: true`, a file otherwise. A path holding `<`, `*` or `?` stands for a
  family, and only its literal head has to exist. Drop the entry when the path goes. **(verify)**
- A generated page is changed at its source, never on the page:
  [PublicApi](../PublicApi/doc.md) from the doc comments of `sandbox/api/` and `sandbox/deps/`,
  [Structure](../Structure/doc.md) from
  `AgnosConfig/structure.yaml`, `README.md` from
  `AgnosConfig/docs/ReadmeHeader.md` and every `doc.yaml`.
- Docs are short, objective and dense: tables, commands, file paths and rules — no prose, no
  narrative, no tutorials, no motivation sections. One page per topic; no sub-doc unless the
  content is a real list of independent items.
- Say a rule once, in this page, and link to it. Links are relative to the file that carries
  them: `../X/doc.md` inside `docs/`, `docs/X/doc.md` in `README.md` and `ReadmeHeader.md`.


## Examples

- An example is `examples/<side>/<name>/`, holding exactly one `example.go` under `lib/`. Create and delete them with `add-lib-example` /
  `remove-lib-example`,
  never by hand — the same rule as `add-doc` / `remove-doc`.
- An example runs with its own directory as the working directory and writes only inside its own
  `test-dir`, which `run-examples` removes before every run.
- An example ends by copying out of `test-dir` into `assert-dir` the paths it asserts, each keeping
  the place it holds in the tree — `assert-dir` is what `result.yaml` records, and `run-examples`
  removes it before every run too. Copying is not moving: `test-dir` stays whole, for reading.
- An example that copies nothing out fails. Assert the paths the example is about and no more:
  a golden holding the whole project breaks on every unrelated template change.
- `result.yaml` is generated by `run-examples`. Refresh one golden with `update-example <name>`, the
  whole suite with `run-examples --update`, or delete it; never edit one.
- An example's output carries no absolute path other than its own directory, no timestamp and no
  resolved version: those are normalized away or make the golden machine-specific.
