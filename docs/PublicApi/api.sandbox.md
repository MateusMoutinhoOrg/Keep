# `sandbox/api/sandbox.go`

## `Sandbox`

Sandbox is the whole library: every part declared in a sandbox/api/<x>sandbox.go file, embedded, plus the two fields every project has. sandbox.New returns it, and nothing callable lives outside of it.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ProjectSandbox` | `ProjectSandbox` | ProjectSandbox is a part of the Sandbox, declared in sandbox/api/projectsandbox.go. Embedded, so each of its fields is read as sandbox.<Field> like any contract. Every struct of a sandbox/api/<x>sandbox.go file is one: each mechanic writes its own, the project writes projectsandbox.go. |
| `Deps` | `*deps.Deps` | Deps is every capability the sandbox reaches the outside world through. It rides on the api so that a function handed the Sandbox holds the whole of what it needs, and can call another field of the api besides — which is what makes a field a caller replaced take effect everywhere. It is also the one field that does not cross into a consumer: an installed copy of this contract carries the api, never the wiring behind it. |
| `Config` | `Config` | Config is what the project knows about itself, built from AgnosConfig/project.yaml (see sandbox/api/config.go). |
