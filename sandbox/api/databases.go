// This file is the whole of Keep's database surface: the Databases contract
// that reaches the Sandbox as the field of the same name, and the types that
// cross it in either direction.
//
// Every type here is a struct — never an interface. A type that carries
// behaviour holds it as function fields, filled by sandbox/internal/databases
// at the moment the object is built; a type that carries none (Field, Schema,
// Props, Error) is plain data a caller writes as a composite literal. None of
// them names the dependencies the library was wired with: a record reaches
// storage through the closure it was built with, not through a field a caller
// could read or replace.
//
// Every object handed back is safe for concurrent use. Writes to one top-level
// collection — and to every collection nested under its records — are
// serialized by a write lock of that collection; reads take no lock.

// Field types, reported by Field.Type. They start at 1, so a Field whose Type
// was left out is refused by Databases.New rather than read as a Key.

	// read as a value.
	Nested
	// Float is a plain floating-point field, stored in the shortest decimal
	// form that parses back to the same number and handed back as a
	// float64.
	Float
	// String is a plain text field. It is written like a Key and read back
	// as a string, but it carries no index: two live records of one
	// collection may hold the same value for it, and Collection.FindByKey
	// never looks a record up by one.
	String
	// Link is a reference to a record of another collection, named by the
	// field's Target. It is stored as that record's id and read back as an
	// int64, and Record.GetLink resolves it to the record itself. Like
	// any id it is never reused, so a link to a removed record resolves to
	// nothing rather than to whatever took its place.
	Link
	// Bytes is a plain binary field. It is written as a []byte and stored
	// exactly as given, with no text encoding, so any content — a file, an
	// image, a hash — comes back byte for byte as a []byte. Like a String
	// it carries no index, and Record.String prints its length rather
	// than its contents.
